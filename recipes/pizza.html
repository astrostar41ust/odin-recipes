    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>

        <li>Prepare the Dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
